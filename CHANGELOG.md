## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Nothing yet.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial public release.

### Added

- Typer-based CLI (`dsoxlab`) driving hands-on labs across multiple lab
  repositories through a declarative contract (`meta.yml` + `lab.yaml`).
- Catalog discovery that scans the current repository's `meta.yml` and every
  `lab.yaml`.
- Three runtimes: `shell`, `incus` (containers) and `kvm` (Terraform +
  libvirt), each opt-in and self-describing.
- Provisioning templates for Incus, KVM/libvirt and Outscale (Terraform HCL and
  cloud-init).
- Infrastructure-level validation with `pytest` + `pytest-testinfra`, including
  persistence-after-reboot checks.
- Scoring and progress tracking persisted in a local XDG SQLite database, with
  variable-cost hints.
- Structure and metadata validators (`dsoxlab validate-structure`).
- Environment diagnostics (`dsoxlab doctor [--fix]`).
- Bilingual (English/French) user interface driven by `DSOXLAB_LANG`.
