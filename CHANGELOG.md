## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **KVM inventory after a targeted provision**: `terraform apply -target` does
  not evaluate root outputs, so KVM host IPs (libvirt DHCP) were missing and
  `dsoxlab check` failed with "Aucun host dans l'inventory" for every KVM lab.
  `apply()` now runs `terraform apply -refresh-only` after a targeted apply to
  recompute the `hosts` output map without recreating resources.

### Added

- **Provider conflict detection**: `dsoxlab provision` stops with a helpful
  message (EN + FR) when another provider (incus/KVM) still has active lab
  infrastructure — they share the lab's network name and subnet and cannot run
  at the same time.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **hints i18n**: the modern hint format (`text_en` / `text_fr`) now also accepts
  base64-encoded values, so hints can be both bilingual and obfuscated in the
  file. The loader tries base64 first and falls back to plain text.

### Changed

- **challenge i18n**: the localized challenge brief is resolved as
  `challenge/README.<lang>.md` (e.g. `README.fr.md`), consistent with
  `scenario.<lang>.md` and the root `README.<lang>.md` — instead of the old
  `README_FR.md` naming.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **progress**: `dsoxlab progress` now shows a clear bloc name (the meta.yml
  section title, e.g. "Fondamentaux (l1)") instead of `?`. Each lab is attached
  to its meta.yml section during discovery (`bloc` + new `bloc_name`), so the
  summary groups by real section instead of an unassigned `bloc=0`.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **multi-host labs**: a `runtime.targets[].roles` mapping (e.g.
  `roles: {server: alma-rhcsa-2.lab}`) lets a `vm` lab use several hosts at once.
  Each role becomes an Ansible group `lab_<role>` (alongside `lab_target`, the
  primary host where tests run), so `setup.yaml` / `solution.yaml` /
  `cleanup.yaml` can configure a server and a client without hard-coding a FQDN.
  The role hosts are validated against the provisioned inventory at run time.
  Backward compatible: no `roles` means a single-host lab as before.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- **provision**: after `terraform apply`, `dsoxlab provision` now waits for each
  host to become truly reachable — `sshd` up, the `student` account created, and
  cloud-init finished (`cloud-init status --wait`) — before returning. This
  removes the "unreachable" (dark) failure that hit the very first `dsoxlab run`
  right after provisioning, so no manual retry is needed. A `HostReadyTimeout`
  falls back to a warning (the VM may still be booting).

### Fixed

- **version**: `__version__` is now read from the installed package metadata
  instead of a hard-coded string, so `dsoxlab --version` stays in sync with
  `pyproject.toml` (it was stuck at `0.1.0`).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- **incus**: `provision --host X` no longer creates the additional disk of
  *other* hosts, and `destroy --host X` now removes that host's own additional
  disk. A `target_hosts` Terraform variable scopes the extra-volume `for_each`,
  and `host_targets` targets the host's own volume so `-target` cleans it up.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial public release.

### Added

- Typer-based CLI (`dsoxlab`) driving hands-on labs across multiple lab
  repositories through a declarative contract (`meta.yml` + `lab.yaml`).
- Catalog discovery that scans the current repository's `meta.yml` and every
  `lab.yaml`.
- Three runtimes: `shell`, `incus` (containers) and `kvm` (Terraform +
  libvirt), each opt-in and self-describing.
- Provisioning templates for Incus, KVM/libvirt and Outscale (Terraform HCL and
  cloud-init).
- Infrastructure-level validation with `pytest` + `pytest-testinfra`, including
  persistence-after-reboot checks.
- Scoring and progress tracking persisted in a local XDG SQLite database, with
  variable-cost hints.
- Structure and metadata validators (`dsoxlab validate-structure`).
- Environment diagnostics (`dsoxlab doctor [--fix]`).
- Bilingual (English/French) user interface driven by `DSOXLAB_LANG`.
